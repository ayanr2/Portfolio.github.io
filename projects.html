      <h4>Character Quiz</h4>
      <a href="ayanr2.github.io/Quiz-Website" target="_blank"><img src="characterquiz.png" alt="characterquiz" id="netflix"></a>
      <figcaption>This project's task was to make a quiz that at the end gives you a character from a show. <br>You answered questions and it will give you the character that most relates to your answers. <br>This project tested our understanding of using if/else condtionals in javascript and <br>I feel I was able to learn a lot through the project making process. <br>A big challenge for me throughout this project was making sure that my if/else statements worked. <br>I took a lot of debugging but I eventually figured it out.</figcaption>

      <h4>Jquery Game</h4>
      <a href="https://ayanr2.github.io/Ayans-jQuery-Game" target="_blank"><img src="JqueryGame.png" alt="jquerygame" id="target"></a>
      <figcaption>For this project we had to make an adventure game using jquery actions. <br>This project was the first time I was seeing these new actions and learning them was an important part to doing this project. <br>My biggest challenge I faced was definitely the restart button. <br>With the click of the button we we're supposed to be brought back to the beginning of the game and I could not figure out why what I was doing was wrong.<br> I made it so that it would hide everything not needed for the first page and showed everything it did need, but it wouldn't work so I made it<br> so when you click the button it links you back to the first page.</figcaption>

      <h4>Chatbot</h4>

      <figcaption>We had to make a chatbot where you would send a message and it would appear in the feed.<br> The most important thing I learned while making the chatbot was the append feature.<br> Append was also the thing I struggled with the most, but after trying to understand it better with the help from my teacher I was able to complete the chatbot.</figcaption>
